# Ammaar Murshid â€“ Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the static site I use to introduce myself and highlight selected engineering projects. It is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so it stays fast and simple to host on GitHub Pages.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt ideas for your own site, but note that the content and structure here were crafted specifically for my portfolio rather than as a drop-in template.
