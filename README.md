# Ammaar Murshid — Portfolio

This repo is my personal portfolio to showcase projects. You may copy snippets for learning; it isn’t intended as a generic template. Update your name, links, and skills in `index.html`/`styles.css`, adjust project logic in `script.js`, and publish via GitHub Pages by pointing the `main` branch under Settings → Pages.
