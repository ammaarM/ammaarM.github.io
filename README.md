# Ammaar Murshid – Personal Portfolio

This is Ammaar Murshid’s personal portfolio, primarily to showcase my projects.

Feel free to browse or adapt ideas for learning, but please note it isn’t a drop-in template.

## Customising it for yourself
1. Update your name, hero copy, and contact links in `index.html`.
2. Swap in your own avatar URL and adjust the Skills section labels and icons to match your stack.
3. Refresh project fallbacks in `script.js` if you want different repositories highlighted when the GitHub API is unavailable.

## Publishing on GitHub Pages
1. Fork or clone the repository, then push your changes to the `main` branch.
2. In the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages for the `main` branch with the root folder.
3. Wait for Pages to deploy, then share your `https://<username>.github.io/` URL.
