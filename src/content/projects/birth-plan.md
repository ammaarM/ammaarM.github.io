**Birth planning, but actually organised.**

Birth Your Way replaces scattered notes, screenshots, and generic templates with a structured guided flow. Instead of piecing together information from random websites, you get:

- **Guided step-by-step planning** – clear prompts that walk you through all the important decisions
- **Personalised birth plan** – tailored to your preferences, not a one-size-fits-all template
- **Downloadable and shareable** – export your plan as a clean PDF to share with your care team
- **All in one place** – no more juggling multiple apps, notes, or browser tabs
